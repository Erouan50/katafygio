# To only include objects matching a kubernetes selector:

# Example exclusions by object kind. E.g.: keep secrets confidential,
# don't dump pods or replicaset  they are all managed by deployments
# or daemonsets (which are already dumped), endpoints (managed by services,
# already dumped), and noisy stuff (events, nodes...).

#  - secret
#  - pod
#  - replicaset

# Example exclusion for specific objects:
#exclude-object:

#  - deployment:default/testdeploy

# Set to true o dump once and exit (instead of continuously dumping new changes)
